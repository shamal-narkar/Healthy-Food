## 🚀 Database Insights: Healthy Food Dashboard 🥗

I recently worked on a data-driven project focused on developing a comprehensive database to categorize and analyze various nutritious food items. This initiative leveraged SQL queries to uncover meaningful insights about food recipes, user contributions, and ingredient compositions.

## 📊 Key Features:

Database Design: Created structured tables for Foods, Users, Recipes, and Recipe-Foods relationships. 

Advanced Queries: 


Implemented subqueries and joins to derive complex insights, such as:

Identifying high-calorie recipes 🍰

Tracking recipe creation by specific users 👩‍🍳

Listing recipes containing specific ingredients 🌿

Interactive Data Views: Generated views for streamlined access to total calories per recipe and detailed food usage.
